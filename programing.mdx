Hey there, I'm Tony. I am a interested in programming. This is a fantastic life's endeavor. It is immitating God's very own creativity. He created the whole world and automated the process. So today he doesn't have to create things again, natural procreation and reproduction ensure the continuity of life. 


In the same vein, programming automates the process of repetitive tasks and saves one the boring,or tedious task of having to do the same thing(s) over and over again.
Some of the programming language I've used include:

- JavaScript
- Python
- TypeScript


With the afore-mentioned languages I have written programs in the following fields

- Web Development
- Mobile App Development
- Games

I have come a long way and I still have a long way to go in the chosen fields of Software Engineering. So wish me luck.
